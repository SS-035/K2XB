# K2XB
This application allows users to use single or multiple keyboards as independent virtual Xbox 360 controller(s).


It uses the RawInput API that allows it to differentiate between multiple keyboards. So, you can set "W" key of one keyboard for Left Thumbstick Up of one controller and same key of another keyboard for Left Shoulder button of another controller and so on. 


Please note that the keyboard will still send input keystrokes while virtual Xbox controller is active.


So to use two (or more) keyboards for PvP in any game (like FIFA), you need to set two (or more) virtual controller each connected to a different keyboard. 


For more detailed instructions, [download the application from release.](https://github.com/SS-035/K2XB/releases/latest/download/K2XB_v0.2.zip)
